✨ Persistent Tasks—How It Works
Your tasks are saved in your browser (localStorage) and will remain even after closing or refreshing the page

Note: Tasks stay only in the current browser on your device (not synced between devices).

On Android: Use your default browser (not incognito/private mode) for persistence.

Not working? Open the app using the link above, not as a file (file://), and avoid strict/private modes.

🏗️ Development (Optional)
Want to run or develop locally?

Clone this repository:

Or use a local server for best results—on mobile/Android, always prefer HTTP over file://:
